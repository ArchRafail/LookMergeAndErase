Compiling some code may fail; your code has to be correct for the compiler to produce an executable version of it.
Do not worry, this page gives you the code you are going to compile.
All you need to do is copy it and paste it in your text editor.

Once the compiler produced the binary file that you need, you can execute this binary file, that will your program.

These two steps: compilation and execution require two specific pieces of software that are part of the Java Development Kit, also known as the JDK.
You will see how to download the JDK for free and how to install it later in this tutorial.

Note that starting with Java SE 11 you can also merge these two steps into one, by executing a .java file directly.
You can use these feature only if you are executing a program that is written in a single file.
This way of executing your java application does not work if your java code spans more than one file.
