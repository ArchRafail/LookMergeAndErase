The name of this Java class is MyFirstClass.
You need to save this text in a file named MyFirstClass.java.
A Java class must be saved in a file that has the same name as your class with the extension .java.
This is mandatory and is in fact very convenient because you do not need to open a file to know what class is written in it.

You can give this class any name as long as it does not start with a number.
There is a convention though: the name of a Java class starts with a capital letter.
This is not mandatory but all Java developers follow this convention.
When you become a seasoned Java developer, seeing a class that does not follow this convention will look weird to you.

If you are following this example to the letter, you should save the MyFirstClass class in a text file called MyFirstClass.java.

Just a word of warning: you should be using a plain text editor to create and save this file. Using a word processor will not work.
